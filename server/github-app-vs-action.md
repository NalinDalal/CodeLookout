# GitHub App vs GitHub Action: MVP Integration Comparison

## 1. What is a GitHub App?
A **GitHub App** is an integration that interacts with the GitHub API as a first-class actor. It can listen to webhooks, perform actions on behalf of users or itself, and has fine-grained permissions. GitHub Apps are installed directly on organizations or repositories and can be distributed via the GitHub Marketplace.

## 2. What is a GitHub Action?
A **GitHub Action** is a workflow automation tool that runs in response to GitHub events (like push, pull request, etc.) within GitHub Actions CI/CD. Actions are defined in YAML files in the repository and run in GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners.

## 3. Use Cases
| Use Case                | GitHub App                                   | GitHub Action                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Automated code review  | Yes (via webhooks & API)                     | Yes (as part of CI workflow)                  |
| Custom UI integration  | Yes (can add checks, comments, UI elements)  | Limited (outputs to PR checks/comments)       |
| Scheduled jobs         | Yes (via external scheduler)                 | Yes (via workflow schedule trigger)           |
| Access to all repos    | Yes (with org-level install)                 | Only where workflow is present                |
| Marketplace listing    | Yes                                          | Yes                                           |

## 4. Pros and Cons

### GitHub App
**Pros:**
- Fine-grained permissions (least privilege)
- Can act independently of user actions
- Can listen to all webhooks
- Can provide richer UI integrations (checks, status, etc.)
- Scalable (runs on your infrastructure)

**Cons:**
- More complex to set up (web server, authentication, hosting)
- Requires external infrastructure
- More complex deployment and maintenance

### GitHub Action
**Pros:**
- Easy to set up (just add YAML to repo)
- Runs on GitHub-hosted infrastructure
- Integrated with GitHub UI (Actions tab)
- No need for external hosting

**Cons:**
- Coarse permissions (repo-level)
- Limited to workflow events and runner environment
- Harder to share state across repos/orgs
- Less flexible for custom UI or API integrations

## 5. Recommendation for CodeLookout MVP
For the MVP, if the goal is to:
- Quickly integrate static analysis into PRs
- Minimize infrastructure and setup
- Leverage GitHubâ€™s built-in CI/CD

**GitHub Action** is recommended for the MVP. It allows fast iteration, easy deployment, and minimal maintenance. You can later migrate to a GitHub App for more advanced features, scalability, and fine-grained permissions.

If you need:
- Organization-wide integration
- Custom UI (checks, dashboards)
- Advanced permissions or event handling

**GitHub App** is the better long-term solution.
