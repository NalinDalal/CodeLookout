# LLM Integration: HuggingFace & Open-Source Models

## 1. Capabilities & Features
### HuggingFace Models
- Wide range of LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Falcon, GPT-Neo, CodeGen)
- Tasks: code generation, summarization, Q&A, code review, translation, etc.
- Model hub with pre-trained and fine-tuned models
- Hosted inference API and self-hosting options

### Other Notable Open-Source LLMs
- **Petals**: Distributed inference for large models (e.g., Llama 2)
- **Ollama**: Local LLM runner with simple API, supports multiple models
- **OpenLLM**: Unified interface for serving open-source LLMs

## 2. Integration Scope
- Use HuggingFace `transformers` and `huggingface_hub` Python libraries for model access
- Options:
  - Use HuggingFace Inference API (cloud, easy, paid)
  - Self-host models (more control, resource intensive)
  - Use third-party runners (Ollama, Petals) for distributed/local inference
- Integrate via REST API, gRPC, or direct Python calls

## 3. Benefits & Challenges
| Aspect         | Benefits                                      | Challenges                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Performance   | Fast with hosted API, scalable with Petals    | Self-hosting needs GPU/CPU resources        |
| Accuracy      | SOTA models, can fine-tune for code           | May need tuning for domain-specific tasks   |
| Cost          | Free for open-source/self-hosted, pay for API | Hardware/infra cost for self-hosting        |
| Integration   | Python SDKs, REST API, CLI tools              | Language/runtime bridging (Go ↔ Python)     |
| Customization | Can fine-tune or select best model            | Fine-tuning requires data and compute       |

## 4. Pre-built Libraries & Tools
- `transformers` (HuggingFace): Model loading, inference, pipelines
- `huggingface_hub`: Model download, versioning, sharing
- `petals`: Distributed inference for large models
- `ollama`: Local LLM runner with REST API
- `openllm`: Unified serving for open-source LLMs

## 5. Integration Process & Use Cases
- **Process:**
  1. Select model (e.g., CodeLlama, StarCoder)
  2. Decide hosting (HuggingFace API, self-host, Ollama, Petals)
  3. Integrate via Python SDK or REST API
  4. Bridge Go ↔ Python (e.g., via REST, gRPC, or subprocess)
  5. Use for code review, summarization, explanation, etc.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Automated code review suggestions
  - Code summarization and documentation
  - PR feedback and inline comments
  - Security and best-practices checks

## 6. Recommendations
- For MVP: Use HuggingFace Inference API or Ollama for quick integration
- For advanced: Self-host with `transformers` or distributed with Petals
- Use REST API for Go ↔ Python communication
- Evaluate models for code review tasks (CodeLlama, StarCoder, etc.)
